# 09h — Domain-logic extraction (slice 1c)

> **Status:** Plan — in progress on `feat/1c-domain-extraction`
> **Parent:** [09-proto-connect-platform.md](09-proto-connect-platform.md) (Phase 1)
> **Follows:** [09g-interceptor-spine.md](09g-interceptor-spine.md) (slice 1b, merged #208)

## Objective

**This is the bulk of Phase 1** (M10): move *every* piece of business logic out of
the ex-`api/` handlers into its `internal/<domain>` package, resource by resource,
so each domain function **accepts and returns proto messages** and **speaks Connect
error codes** directly. Nothing is left inline because it "looked simple" — that is
how `updateIncident` reached 470 lines. ~11.6k LOC of handler code has to find its
real home.

1b gave us the spine (interceptors + one proven RPC). 1c gives every RPC a real
domain function to call. **1d** (next slice) then writes the thin RPC method and
reduces each REST handler to a shim over the *same* domain function — so the two
transports never carry two implementations (M13). 1c and 1d are close cousins;
the split is: **1c = the domain functions exist and are tested; 1d = both
transports call them.** In practice a resource is taken end-to-end (extract →
wire RPC → shim REST) before moving to the next, so this plan and 09i interleave.

## The three things that land in this slice

1. **`RunInTx` — ALREADY EXISTS (`go/store/tx.go`), no work needed.** Discovered
   at the start of 1c: `(*DBQ).RunInTx` already retries **1213** (deadlock) and
   **1205** (lock-wait timeout) via `errors.As` into `*mysql.MySQLError` (never by
   string), with backoff and `maxTxAttempts`, and is already used (e.g.
   `store/areas.go`); `store/tx_test.go` covers `retryableTxErr`. It landed earlier
   for the parallel attach/detach de-flake. So 1c does **not** build it — it just
   **applies** it to the multi-statement writes being extracted that don't yet use
   it. (If `TestCreateAndGetIncident` still flakes, check whether the incident
   create/attach path actually wraps its writes in `RunInTx`.)
2. **Path-scoped `funlen`** on the handler files, enabled in `.golangci.yml` in the
   *same* slice so the rule is enforced from the moment it exists rather than argued
   about later. It is what forces "extract everything" to actually happen.
3. **The extraction itself**, resource by resource.

## Extraction pattern (per resource)

For each resource, in the ex-`api/`-now-`internal/<domain>` handler:

- Identify the business logic (validation beyond protovalidate, authz checks,
  DB orchestration, notification/metric side effects).
- Move it into a domain function with a **proto-shaped signature**:
  `func (d *Domain) DoThing(ctx, *rpcv1.DoThingRequest) (*rpcv1.DoThingResponse, error)`,
  returning `connect.NewError(connect.Code…, err)` for failures.
- **Authorization stays in Go** (M5 puts only *validation* in the contract) — keep
  the `authz` checks, the `mayViewIncident` privacy gate, the private-incident 404,
  the last-admin guard, etc. exactly as they are; just relocate them.
- Wrap multi-statement writes in `RunInTx`.
- The REST handler keeps working throughout (calls the new function, adapts to/from
  its existing JSON DTOs for now); it becomes a pure shim in 1d.

## Resource order (from 09 §6)

incidents → reports → people/auth → taxonomies (incident types, outcomes) →
events/areas/crews → metrics/action log. Incidents first because they are the
hardest and everything else is lighter once the pattern is proven. The
incident-management cluster (`internal/incident` = incident+report+visit+journal+
attachment) is one package by design (1a finding: mutually recursive), so its
resources are extracted together.

## Guardrails (do not regress these — CLAUDE.md)

- **Privacy:** any endpoint surfacing incident content must honor
  `mayViewIncident`; an unauthorized single read returns **404**, not 403.
- **Action logging:** the Connect tier is now default-on via the interceptor
  (1b) keyed off `idempotency_level = NO_SIDE_EFFECTS`; as each **read** RPC's
  domain function lands, annotate that RPC in the proto (fails safe otherwise —
  it over-logs, never misses a mutation). REST still uses `LogRequest(true,…)`.
- **Admin escalation:** only `claims.PersonAdmin()` may mint admins; last-admin
  clear returns 409.
- **No behaviour change:** the Playwright suite + both integration suites are the
  regression net. Run `go test ./api/integration ./store/integration` after each
  resource; they use raw-SQL seeds and catch schema/query drift.

## Verification gate (per resource, and slice-wide)

- [ ] `go build ./...`, `go vet`, `gofmt`, `go test ./...` green.
- [ ] golangci-lint 0 issues **including the new path-scoped `funlen`**.
- [ ] `go run bin/build/build.go` regenerates + compiles; `buf lint` clean.
- [ ] both integration suites green; Playwright smoke unaffected.
- [ ] `RunInTx` has a test proving it retries 1213/1205 and gives up on others.

## Workflow (from memory — do not deviate)

- Branch `feat/1c-domain-extraction` off master. **Never auto-merge**; open the PR
  and leave it for the user, or merge only after they say so.
- Land in **reviewable chunks** — this slice is large, so a PR per resource (or a
  small group) is better than one 11.6k-line PR. Target master directly; if a
  prior chunk merges first, rebase `--onto master`.
- All Go commands run from `go/`. macOS BSD `sed` has no `\b` — use perl/python for
  identifier renames.

## Resume pointer (for an autonomous continuation)

State lives in git + memory, not here. To continue: `git log --oneline -5` on
`feat/1c-domain-extraction` (or master, if a chunk merged), read the newest §7
finding and the memory file `maybloom-stack-go-adoption.md`, then take the next
resource in the order above. `RunInTx` already exists (item 1), and the pattern is
proven end-to-end on **`ListEvents`** (the tracer — see `internal/event/event.go`,
`api/connect.go`, `server.ConnectErrorToHTTP`, and the §7 "1c" finding). Next:
**incidents** — pick an incident RPC (e.g. `GetIncident`, a read), move its handler
logic in `internal/incident` into a proto-shaped domain function returning Connect
errors, add the RPC method to `ImsService`, reduce the REST handler to a shim, then
verify. **Defer `funlen`:** the path-scoped rule can only be enabled once the files
it scopes are actually thin, so it lands near the END of 1c — turning it on now
would fail lint on every not-yet-extracted handler.
